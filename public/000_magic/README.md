# Noir 0: The Enigmatic Invitation

## Prompt

The rain had settled into a steady rhythm against the windows, a melancholic tune that echoed the mystery of the night. Detective Vivian Noir reclined in her creaky chair, the amber glow of a desk lamp casting elongated shadows across her worn-out office. The tendrils of cigarette smoke danced upward, intertwining with the questions that lingered in the air. A sudden jingle disrupted her thoughts—the phone.

The voice on the other end was like gravel underfoot, a man spun a tale of a missing archaeologist—a mystery that had eluded logic. The caller spoke of hidden images and cryptic magic eye puzzles. Vivian's skepticism rose; such cases rarely piqued her interest. But as the line went dead, a folded parchment slipped under her office door. The chaotic patterns etched upon it seemed meaningless, yet when she allowed her focus to blur, an intricate design emerged, tattooed onto her mind.
