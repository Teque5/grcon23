# Voice Scrambler

## General Idea

Great flowgraph for voice scrambler and provide a sample input and output. Embed the flag in the voice recording.

I really like the way [the CRY2001 scrambler](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/CRY2001_Voice_Scrambler) sounds and I'd like to create a flowgraph for encoding / decoding.
