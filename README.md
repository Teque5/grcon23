# Challenges for GRCon 23 by Aerospace Team Platypus

## Overview

All of our challenges are independent, but there is a detective story to the flavortext that ties them all together. This year we assigned our puzzles points in the range of (25, 100) based on difficulty.

## Layout

Each challenge has a `public/` folder that holds files facing the challenger, and a `private/` folder with solutions and creation files for the challenge.

## Order of Challenges

All challenges should be released sequentially over the _first_ day at GRCon.
