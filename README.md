# Challenges for GRCon 23

## Overview

All of our challenges are independent, but there is a pseudo story to the flavortext that ties them all together.
We pretend 100 is a base point value and suggest a number based on difficulty. Scale as appropriate.

## Layout

Each challenge has a `public/` folder that holds files facing the challenger, and a `private/` folder with solutions and creation files for the challenge.

## Order of Challenges

0. `000_???/`
1. `001_???/`
2. `002_???/`

## Prior Work

Our 2022 challenge repository [can be found here](https://github.com/bebau/grcon22).
